# WP Password Argon2id

This is work uses the source-code from the amazing work developed at [WP Password Argon Two](https://github.com/TypistTech/wp-password-argon-two) but changes the hashing algorithm from Argon2i to Argon2id.

## TODO:
- Draw inspiration from [roots/wp-password-bcrypt](https://github.com/roots/wp-password-bcrypt) and [PHP Native password hash](https://wordpress.org/plugins/password-hash/) to update the code and make the UX better.
